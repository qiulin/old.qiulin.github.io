Hi, guys, I'm qiulin (aka xcodeman sometimes), you can also call me Charlie Lee, if you are a English speaker.

I'm a newbie at DevOps and interested in Linux, Nginx, Python and GlusterFS. I also do some developing like web and so on in my spare time.

Because I'm learning English, you can see this page.

OK, that's all, enjoy it.
